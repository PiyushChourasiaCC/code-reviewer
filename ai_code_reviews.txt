## Risk Analysis Table

| #  | Risk/Check Area                               | Count/Present?  | Notes / Examples                                                                                                                                         | Potential Fix / Mitigation                                                                                     | Checks for Review        |
|----|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1  | Exception logging (ExceptionLog)              | 0 – **NOT Present**  | Caught exceptions are returned via `errorResponse()` (setting status=error in response), but not logged to a persistent ExceptionLog.                    | Add ExceptionLog insertion (custom object, platform event, or System.debug+platform event) in all catch blocks.| Are error cases traceable?|
| 2  | Exception handling best practices             | Partial          | Almost all try/catch blocks **swallow exceptions** or return objects, but don’t propagate, log, or differentiate exception types. See `getPromptOptions`, `getVectorStoreIds`, etc. |  Log all exceptions. At minimum, add a comment for "fail silent" blocks, and propagate when needed.            | Does every catch at least log?|
| 3  | Global interface/classes                      | **YES**          | Utility class is `global with sharing`; inner classes not global. Apex interface usage in dynamic method execution (`AIAgenticInterface`).               | Evaluate if `global` is needed; prefer `public` if not used in managed package externally.                     | Limit class visibility?  |
| 4  | Jira/Work ID in comments                      | **NO**           | No comments with Jira/Work/Incid numbers observed in the code. Good for cleanliness.                                                                   | N/A – not present                                                                                             | Should requirements be referenced?|
| 5  | Hardcoded IDs                                 | **NO**           | No hardcoded SF IDs found. ID use (e.g. UserInfo.getUserId(), record loopups) are all dynamic or query-based.                                            | N/A                                                                                                            | Are all IDs dynamic?     |
| 6  | Bulkification (DML & Query in loops)          | **MOSTLY OK**    | No queries inside loops via direct iteration. Some DMLs in `for` loop of `invokeAgent` for `AI_Usage_Tracking__c` update, but objects collected in a list first. | Consider possible list growth for `upsertDML` and Governor Limit safety for future scale-out.                  | DML safely outside loops?|
| 7  | Security: Dynamic SOQL/safe variable binding  | **PARTIAL RISK** | Dynamic SOQL in `getDynamicQueryResults`, `fetchUser`. Variables are parsed/inserted in query using string replacement, not bind variables!             | Always use bind variables or at least strict single-quote wrapping and input escaping (ideally bind syntax).   | Any SOQL injection risk? |
| 8  | Security: FLS/CRUD checking                   | **YES**          | DML/queries are wrapped sometimes with `FLSCheck.getInstance()`. However, some points do direct query/DMLs (customs only).                              | Audit for gaps; Review FLSCheck implementation for security strength.                                          | Is DML access controlled?|
| 9  | Security: Dynamic instantiation               | **RISK**         | Use `Type.forName` on Apex class name from database. No input validation; could execute any class if data altered.                                      | Validate/whitelist allowed class names before instantiation.                                                   | Is `Type.forName` safe?  |
| 10 | Swallowing exceptions silently                | **YES**          | Functions like `getPromptOptions` and `getVectorStoreIds` catch Exception and just return default/empty objects. No error surfaced/logged.               | At minimum, use `System.debug`+ ExceptionLog. Ideally, error is surfaced to calling context or admin.         | Do silent failures mask issues?|
| 11 | Use of "with sharing"                         | **YES**          | The class is declared "with sharing". Good default for enforcing row-level security.                                                             | Good. Consider "without sharing" only for well-justified system/data operations.                               | Are sharing rules enforced?|
| 12 | Label/text best practices                     | **YES**          | UI/text messages (system prompts, error messages) are all label-driven; little to no hardcoded user-facing text except one constant.                   | Good                                                                                                           | Are all messages customizable?|
| 13 | Tech debt (complexity, comments, TODOs)       | **SOME**         | No TODO/FIXME/JIRA flags. Methods getting lengthy (e.g. `invokeAgent`, 100+ LOC). Some blocks nested heavily, lots of try/catch.                       | Refactor large methods, split logic for clarity, enforce max indentation/nesting.                              | Are functions maintainable?    |
| 14 | Use of static limits and resource control     | **OK**           | List sizes/iteration controlled. Some queries use LIMITs, but consider more explicit checks for very large object loads in future.                      | Add limits/guards for future proofing if called in true bulk/batch.                                            | Are there unbounded queries?|
| 15 | Salesforce platform API version/language      | **OK**           | No deprecated calls visible, all methods use modern syntax/APIs.                                                                                        | N/A                                                                                                            | Platform compatibility?   |

---

## **Summary Key Points / Recommendations:**

1. **Add ExceptionLog Logging:**  
   Every catch(Exception ex) should record details persistently. Consider a custom object or Platform Event for "ExceptionLog".

2. **Avoid Dynamic SOQL Injection:**  
   Refactor all `.replace()` string-based SOQL to bind variables or very thoroughly sanitize/escape input.

3. **Harden Dynamic Type Instantiation:**  
   Never instantiate classes from unchecked DB data. Add allowed-list logic or clear validation.

4. **Document/Handle Silent Catch:**  
   For each silent catch, use System.debug at a minimum, and add a code comment about why error is ignored.

5. **Consider Splitting Large Methods:**  
   For testability and maintainability, methods like `invokeAgent` should be split into smaller units.

6. **Revisit Visibility:**  
   If the class is not part of a managed package or not exposed to external apps, consider reducing global to public.

## **Quick Compliance Checklist:**
- [ ] All exceptions logged
- [ ] No queries built with unsafe unbound dynamic SOQL
- [ ] No hardcoded IDs
- [ ] No DML in loops
- [ ] All UI text in labels
- [ ] All class/instantiation via whitelist
- [ ] "with sharing" present
- [ ] FLS/CRUD checked before DML
- [ ] No Jira/ticket leakage in prod code

| 2  | Exception Handling Consistency               | 2     | `createAccount`, `createContact` use custom serialization; others use `errorResponse()` | Standardize error handling via helper, always return same JSON structure                             | Some inconsistency                             |
| 3  | Exception Stack Trace Visibility             | 1     | `System.debug(e.getStackTraceString())` in `createContact`     | **Never log stack in prod**. Use proper logging or error propagation                                 | Potential info exposure in debug logs          |
| 4  | Global Interface Usage                       | 0     | Implements `AIAgenticInterface`, assumed local; not global     | Confirm that interface is not `global` unless required                                               | Appears safe                                   |
| 5  | Presence of Jira Numbers in Comments         | 0     | No Jira #s or references in comments                           | Add reference to Jira/user story IDs if policy required                                               | Lacking traceability/reference                 |
| 6  | Hardcoded IDs                               | 0     | No hardcoded Salesforce IDs found                              | Best practice; dynamic object/field use is OK                                                        | **Pass**                                      |
| 7  | SOQL Injection Risk                         | 6+    | Dynamic SOQL built from parameters (all `find*/fetch*` methods) | **HIGH RISK**: Validate & escape all user input, use bind variables, avoid dynamic query if possible | Major security vulnerability                   |
| 8  | Bulkification                               | ?     | All methods process single parameter set; no bulk/batch logic  | Consider extending for bulk operations, if called in loops; not triggered context                    | Some risk if called in bulk context            |
| 9  | Field Level Security (FLS)                  | 2     | Used (`FLSCheck.getInstance()`) for `Case`, `CaseComment` only | Apply FLS check for all objects being DML’d (Account, Contact)                                       | FLS not universal                              |
| 10 | Object Permissions Check                     | Most  | Used before querying/creating objects except in some `fetch*`  | Standardize permission checks before any DML or query                                                | Some inconsistencies                           |
| 11 | Magic Strings or Enum Risks                  | Many  | `"read"`, `"create"` etc as parameter values in methods        | Use `enum`s or constants rather than magic strings                                                   | Tech debt: risk of typo/maintenance            |
| 12 | Parameter Injection via `Map<String,Object>` | Many  | All CRUD/query methods accept arbitrary parameter map           | Input validation & whitelisting field names and values                                               | **Major risk:** security, data integrity       |
| 13 | No CRUD/FLS Check for Account, Contact DML   | 2     | `createAccount`, `createContact` skip `hasObjectPerm` and FLS  | Must add checks before DML for all objects                                                           | Tech debt & compliance gap                     |

### Priority Focus (Action Items)

1. **High Severity:**
   - **SOQL Injection:** ALL dynamic query building is at high risk. Only allow whitelisted fields and apply correct escaping or use bind variables where possible.
   - **No Exception Logging:** Add error logging to an ExceptionLog object or class—even just `System.debug` is not sufficient for production-grade error tracking.
   - **Parameter Validation:** Strongly validate input maps for supported fields and data types to minimize security risk.
   - **CRUD/FLS Checks Needed:** For ALL object DML (Account, Contact), not just `Case`.

2. **Medium:**
   - Standardize exception handling: use the same error mechanism everywhere.
   - Remove or restrict stack trace logging.
   - Consider JIRA/story traceability if relevant to your org.

3. **Minor/Tech Debt:**
   - Avoid magic strings for permissions.
   - Consider code for bulkification or document that only single-record ops are supported.
   - Optionally allow for dynamic or configurable fields in query (if security can be assured).

---

## Code Review Recommendations

- **Refactor dynamic SOQL**: Only build queries with allowed fields, and use `String.escapeSingleQuotes()` for user-supplied values at a minimum—but prefer field whitelisting and bind variables.
- **Centralize error handling**: Always use the same error method, and log all exceptions to a persistent store.
- **Enforce CRUD/FLS**: Use utilities for every object’s DML, not just Case/CaseComment.
- **Sanitize/validate input**: Only allow explicitly permitted field names/values from the incoming `parameters`.
- **General**: Do not expose stack traces to users and enhance security posture by validating all entry points for risk.

=== Review: AIAgenticInterface.cls ===
Here's a summary assessment of the provided **AIAgenticInterface.cls** file. Your code is an *interface* rather than an implementation class, so the risk surface is primarily in the design/standards choices, not runtime/logic issues.

Below is the requested analysis:

| **Risk Count** | **Notes**                                                                                                       | **Potential Fix**                                                                                                                         | **Checks**                                                                                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0              | No usage of ExceptionLog; but as an interface, this is expected.                                                | Ensure implementing classes handle exception logging as needed.                                                                           | Review all implementations for ExceptionLog/additional logging.                                      |
| 1              | Exception handling not present (by design in interfaces).                                                        | Document that implementations must perform robust exception handling and proper error signaling.                                          | Implementation contracts should clearly state exception behavior and expected logging.               |
| 1              | Interface is declared as `public`, not `global` (good). No unnecessary exposure.                                | Maintain scope as `public` unless cross-namespace/global use is required.                                                                | ❌ No risk found here; just ensure future scope increases are justified (global should be avoided).   |
| 0              | No JIRA numbers observed in comments.                                                                           | Consider referencing JIRA/ticket numbers in code changes for traceability, especially for critical updates.                              | Add JIRA IDs to comments where relevant for future changes.                                          |
| 1              | Salesforce standards: No hardcoded IDs or unbulkified queries appear; sample block uses dynamic SOQL & good map usage. | No immediate fix; but highlight when sample is copied into implementations, dynamic SOQL/SOSL must be scrutinized to avoid injection.     | Always sanitize inputs when composing dynamic queries.                                                |
| 1              | Sample code (commented) concatenates user-supplied values into an SOSL query (`searchTerm`, `fieldToSearchIn`).  | Always escape/sanitize or use bind variables (SOSL/where applicable) to avoid injection vulnerabilities.                                 | Ensure safe usage in implementations; add comments about input sanitization in interface itself.      |

### Key Points

- **Exception logging/handling:** Not possible in interfaces, but clarify requirements in documentation or interface contract (JavaDoc).
- **Global classes:** *Not global*—good. `public` is correct for internal org use.
- **JIRA numbers in comments:** None found. Not required, but could help future traceability.
- **Salesforce coding standards:** No hardcoded IDs or DML/queries (in interface). Sample code builds queries with proper patterns, but it risks SOQL/SOSL injection.
- **Tech Debt or Security Risk:**  
  - **Dynamic query composition** in the sample code carries risk if copy-pasted into real code.
  - **No direct security issue**, but a caution **should be documented or enforced for all implementations**.

### Recommendations:

- **Add clear notes in the interface Javadoc:** Specify that implementations *must* perform exception handling and input sanitization for dynamic queries.
- **Audit all implementations** of this interface for proper:  
  a) Exception logging/handling  
  b) SOQL/SOSL injection safety  
- **No direct risk in this interface,** but sample code should be accompanied by strong warnings.
